## Hi! My name  is Victoria Firsanova (she/her). I am NLP/ConvAI researcher.

I'm a master student from [Saint Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru). I am developing apps for marginalised communities. For some time I was researching the language of drug addicts, and the aim of my current project is to create an app on autism awareness. You can find more about the project on autism on the [Open Data Science page](https://ods.ai/projects/asd_qa).

* *[The Advantages of Human Evaluation of Sociomedical Question Answering Systems](http://www.injoit.org/index.php/j1/article/view/1227)*

Abstract: The paper presents a study on question answering systems evaluation. The purpose of the study is to determine if human evaluation is indeed necessary to qualitatively measure the performance of a sociomedical dialogue system. The study is based on the data from several natural language processing experiments conducted with a question answering dataset for inclusion of people with autism spectrum disorder and state-of-the-art models with the Transformer architecture. The study describes model-centric experiments on generative and extractive question answering and data-centric experiments on dataset tuning. The purpose of both model- and data-centric approaches is to reach the highest F1-Score. Although F1-Score and Exact Match are well-known automated evaluation metrics for question answering, their reliability in measuring the performance of sociomedical systems, in which outputs should be not only consistent but also psychologically safe, is questionable. Considering this idea, the author of the paper experimented with human evaluation of a dialogue system for inclusion developed in the previous phase of the work. The result of the study is the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of automated and human approaches to evaluate conversational artificial intelligence systems, in which the psychological safety of a user is essential.


* *[The Description of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Question Answering Dataset](http://www.dialog-21.ru/en/dialogue2021/results/dopmat/2021/students/)*

Abstract: The study presents the Autism Spectrum Disorder Question Answering Dataset (ASD QA), a new Russian dataset based on the structure of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), a machine reading comprehension dataset. The ASD QA dataset is a work in progress. The dataset version described in the paper consists of 1,134 question-answer pairs compiled by the author of the paper from the information website for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and Asperger’s syndrome and their parents. The paper also describes several question-answering models built to analyze the dataset.

Abstract: The study focuses on building an informational Russian language chatbot, which aims to answer neurotypical and atypical people’s questions about the inclusion of people with autism spectrum disorder and Asperger syndrome, in particular. Assuming that lack of awareness about the inclusion process and characteristics of people with special needs might cause communication difficulties or even conflicts between pupils, university and college students, or co-workers, a chatbot, which is based on reliable sources, provides the information informally and allows asking uncomfortable questions, could perhaps reduce stress levels during the inclusion. The paper describes two conceptual models of the chatbot. The first one is based on traditional language modeling with GPT-2, and the second one is based on BERT applied to question answering. The training data is collected from the informational websites about ASD, and its usage is agreed with the administration. For training BERT for question answering, the dataset structure was transformed according to the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). F1-score and perplexity metrics were used to evaluate the systems. The study shows the effectiveness of building conceptual models in tracking weaknesses and making significant adjustments at the design stage.

### My projects

* [Autism Spectrum Disorder QA](https://ods.ai/projects/asd_qa)

Autism Spectrum Disorder QA, or ASD QA, is a project that supports the inclusion of people with special needs. First of all, it is a dataset for question-answering used for building an informational Russian language chatbot for the inclusion of people with autism spectrum disorder and Asperger syndrome in particular, based on the data from the informational website. The usage of the data is agreed.
